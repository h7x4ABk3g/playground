# The playground
Programming languages as they were toys

## What is the playground?

The playground is

 - A place to test out stuff that probably shouldn't work, but still somehow does
 - A place to store excessive, useless code from stackoverflow, that might turn out useful one day
 - A place to come when you're procastinating and have gotten this absolutely sick idea of something that might or might not be possible.


## What isn't the playground?

The playground it not

 - The most beautiful, quality code you've ever seen in your life
 - Maintained code that is supposed to work. Probably only half of it does.
 - A community driven project. This is just me playing around when I probably should be doing other things.
